# Blink Shell Fonts

With [Blink Shell](http://www.blink.sh) you can have your terminal, your way. We know how important it is for you to have your color scheme and the font that you feel comfortable looking at all day. And don't forget to send us your PR to share them with others too!

We prefer fonts that are patched with Powerline characters, and will indicate that in our gallery. And extra points for ligatures too!

To install them on Blink, just paste the URL of the CSS font under Appearance -> Fonts -> New Font. If you would like to learn how to create your own, [continue reading!](https://github.com/blinksh/blink/blob/raw/Resources/FontsAndThemes.md)
